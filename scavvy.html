Did you ever hear the tragedy of Scavvy The Wise?<br />
I thought not. It’s not a story TerraGroup would tell you.<br />
It’s a Scav legend.<br />
Scavvy was a Dark Lord of the Scav Nation, so powerful and so wise he could help hatchlings to get gear…<br />
He had such a knowledge of Tarkov that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.<br />
The Dark Side of Tarkov is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.<br />
He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing was his power, which eventually, of course, he did.<br />
Unfortunately, he taught his friend everything he knew, then his friend killed him while he was reading chat.<br />
Ironic.<br />
He could save others from death, but not himself.
