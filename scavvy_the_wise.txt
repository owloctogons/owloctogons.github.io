Did you ever hear the tragedy of Scavvy The Wise?
I thought not. It’s not a story TerraGroup would tell you.
It’s a Scav legend.
Scavvy was a Dark Lord of the Scav Nation, so powerful and so wise he could help hatchlings to get gear…
He had such a knowledge of Tarkov that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
The Dark Side of Tarkov is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing was his power, which eventually, of course, he did.
Unfortunately, he taught his friend everything he knew, then his friend killed him while he was reading chat.
Ironic.
He could save others from death, but not himself.
